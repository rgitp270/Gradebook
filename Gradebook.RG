# You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.

# Create a list called subjects and fill it with the classes you are taking
subjects = ["physics","calculus","poetry","history"] 

#Create a list called grades and fill it with your scores
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88] 

# Manually (without any methods) create a two-dimensional list to combine subjects and grades. Use the table below as a reference to associated values.
gradebook = [["physics", 98],["calculus", 97],["poetry", 85],["history", 88]]

# Print gradebook
print(gradebook)

#Use the .append() method to add a list with the values of "computer science" and an associated grade value of 100 to our two-dimensional list of gradebook.
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])

# Your grade for "visual arts" just came in! You got a 93! Use append to add ["visual arts", 93] to gradebook.
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])

# Our instructor just told us they made a mistake grading and are rewarding an extra 5 points for our visual arts class. Access the index of the grade for your visual arts class and modify it to be 5 points greater.
gradebook[5][1] = 98

# You decided to switch from a numerical grade value to a Pass/Fail option for your poetry class. Find the grade value in your gradebook for your poetry class and use the .remove() method to delete it.
gradebook[2].remove(85)

#Use the .append() method to then add a new "Pass" value to the sublist where your poetry class is located.
gradebook[2].append("Pass")

# Create a new variable full_gradebook that combines both last_semester_gradebook and gradebook using + to have one complete grade book.
last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]
full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook

# Print full_gradebook to see our completed list.
print(full_gradebook)
